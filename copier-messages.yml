  You are about to create a new Python project.
  
  You'll be asked a series of questions; the answers will be used to prepare
  a basic, pre-configured Python project skeleton.
  
  For more information, visit:
  
  https://github.com/frkl-dev/python-project-template

_message_after_copy: |
  
  Your project '{{ project_name }}' has been created successfully.
  
  Check out the documentation how to use the features included in this template here:
  
  https://github.com/frkl-dev/python-project-template
  
  The next steps are:
  
  1. change directory to the project root
  
    cd {{ _copier_conf.dst_path }}
  
  2. create a new repository in your Github account ({{ github_user }}) with the name:
  
    {{ project_slug }}
  
  3. add the Github repository as remote:
  
    git remote add origin git@github.com:{{ github_user }}/{{ project_slug }}.git
    
    # or:
  
    git remote add origin https://github.com/{{ github_user }}/{{ project_slug }}.git
  
  4. push the initial version:
  
    git push --set-upstream origin develop
  
    Now visit the Github Actions tab in your new repo and check that the pre-configured actions all run without error:
  
    https://github.com/{{ github_user }}/{{ project_slug }}/actions
  
  5. check the `TODO.md` file in the project folder for details on how to publish your project to PyPI and Anaconda:
  
    https://github.com/{{ github_user }}/{{ project_slug }}/blob/develop/TODO.md
  

_message_after_update: |
  
  Your project '{{ project_name }}' has been updated.
  
  Check the changes manually using:
  
    git status
    # and/or
    git diff
  
  In case of conflicts, you'll have to resolve those before committing/pushing the changes to your remote repository.
